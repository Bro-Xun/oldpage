[00:10.09]We used to hide under the covers
[00:13.21]Serenade each other with careless melodies
[00:19.72]Something buried deep inside us
[00:22.46]The major and the minor
[00:24.84]We're like piano keys
[00:27.24]You played for me
[00:31.78]You played for me
[00:36.47]You played for me
[00:38.27]I swear it
[00:39.18]Even in my sleep I hear it
[00:41.51]Like the memory of every thing we used to be
[00:46.02]You played for me
[00:55.50]You played for me
[01:05.12]You played for me
[01:08.96]We couldn't stop the world from turning
[01:12.04]It was like a whirlwind
[01:14.28]Scattered us like leaves
[01:18.54]But I'm stuck inside a feeling
[01:21.20]The song that never leaves
[01:23.11]We were like a symphony
[01:26.19]You played for me
[01:30.59]You played for me
[01:35.32]You played for me
[01:37.07]I swear it
[01:37.99]Even in my sleep I hear it
[01:40.36]Like the memory of every thing we used to be
[01:44.83]You played for me
[01:54.38]You played for me
[02:03.64]You played for me
[02:07.61]You and me
[02:09.76]You and me me
[02:12.11]You and me me
[02:17.00]You and me
[02:19.20]You and me me
[02:21.53]You and me
[02:22.27]You played for me
[02:33.50]I swear it
[02:34.35]Even in my sleep I hear it
[02:36.78]Like the memory of every thing we used to be
